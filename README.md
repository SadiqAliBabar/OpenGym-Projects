# 🏋️‍♂️ OpenGym Projects  

Welcome to my **OpenAI Gym** adventures! 🚀 This repo contains my experiments with **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** using OpenAI Gym environments. From navigating taxis to balancing poles and conquering mountains, I've explored different RL algorithms to solve classic control and grid-based problems.  

## 🕹️ Environments Covered  
✅ **Taxi-v3** – Teach an AI how to be the best taxi driver! 🚖  
✅ **FrozenLake-v1** – Don't slip! An RL agent navigates an icy lake. ❄️  
✅ **MountainCar-v0** – Pushing a car uphill using momentum! 🚗  
✅ **CartPole-v1** – Balancing a pole on a moving cart! 🎢  

## ⚡ What’s Inside?  
📜 **Q-Learning Implementation** – Learning from rewards & penalties.  
📂 **Trained Models** – Pre-trained Q-tables (pickled files) to test agents.  
📊 **Performance Graphs** – See how learning progresses over time.  

## 🚀 How to Run?  
1️⃣ Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SadiqAliBabar/OpenGym-Projects.git
   cd OpenGym-Projects
   ```  
2️⃣ Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3️⃣ Run a project, for example:  
   ```bash
   python taxi_qlearning.py
   ```  

## 📌 Future Plans  
- Implement **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** 🧠  
- Try **SARSA & Double Q-Learning**  
- Optimize training efficiency
